RC_cloud Executable

Please place the 'data.xlsx' file in the ROOT DIRECTORY of the D: drive (NOT C, NOT E, NOT F, BUT D).
Then double-click to run 'RC_cloud.exe' (executable can reside in any directory).
Then, you can see the calculated results on your screen, and you can find them in the 'data.xlsx'. (If not, please check step #1)

#1 If you do not have MATLAB installed:
Prerequisites for Deployment 

Verify that 【version 9.11 (R2021b) of the MATLAB】 Runtime is installed.   
If not, you can run the MATLAB Runtime installer.
To find its location, enter
  
    >>mcrinstaller
      
at the MATLAB prompt.
NOTE: You will need administrator rights to run the MATLAB Runtime installer. 
We are sorry that we have not tested any other versions of MATLAB. Therefore, it is better to use [version R2021b]. (lol)

Alternatively, download and install the Windows version of the MATLAB Runtime for R2021b 
from the following link on the MathWorks website:

    https://www.mathworks.com/products/compiler/mcr/index.html
   
For more information about the MATLAB Runtime and the MATLAB Runtime installer, see 
"Distribute Applications" in the MATLAB Compiler documentation  
in the MathWorks Documentation Center.

#2 If you wish to customize the parameters:
Please modify the data in the 'data.xlsx' file, specifically in sheets 1, A2:G6.
Then, SAVE and CLOSE the file. (This step is important)

#3 If you have any questions or specific customization requests:
Please contact: ch18511992966@163.com
